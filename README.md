<h1 align="center">Catering Restaurant Web Page</h1>

# Introduction
This was my first React Project, so it's for academic purposes. I wanted to learn how React works, hooks, components, all the basics.
This website is a Restaurant of Catering.

My first project with React.
This project has just been deployed, and I am using it for educational purposes. So, it is not on distribution. I just upload my project for community feedback, and to show my experience working on this framework. 

This project was conducted in December 2023.

# Usage 
Deployed on Netlify: [Click here](https://cateringrestaurant.netlify.app/)

First we have a products section where we can add to the cart *("A침adir al carrito")*, but first we need to log in.
On *"Iniciar Sesion"* button we have this feature. 
(Login with hardcoded data)

![Login Client](https://github.com/Isaac4Lion/Catering-Web-Page/assets/92281039/b853c9a6-05ce-4321-97e7-32a38467a5ff)

`For users:`
```js
{
 user: "Isaac",
 pass: "123"
},
{
 user: "Kevin",
 pass: "345"
}
```

We have an option to change to admin login:

`For admins:`

```js
{
 usuario : 'IsaacAdmin',
 password : '123'
},
{
 usuario : 'KevinAdmin',
 password : '345'
}
```
`Shopping Cart:` 
I am specially interested in how data can be used. So, for the products I made a Json for the products with the next structure:
```js
{
 id: 1,
 nombreProducto: 'Tacos de carne',
 imagenSRC: '../productos/producto1.png',
 descripcion: "Nuestros tacos de carne asada est치n elaborados con finas rebanadas de carne de res marinadas en una mezcla de especias tradicionales, que se asan a la perfecci칩n para obtener un sabor jugoso y lleno de aroma. Combinamos la carne asada con ingredientes frescos y sabrosos, como cebolla picada, cilantro fresco, y un toque de lim칩n para realzar los sabores.",
 precioUnidad: 3,
 precioDocena: 24,
 cantidad: 1
}, ...
```
And for the products on the Shopping Cart, I use useState where we save in an array named allProducts, and a integer state named countProducts. 

We add the product by id, when we update the state to show in shopping cart and the counter on `header component`. The same happens with the delete button on the `Shopping Cart Section`.

# Some more features 游댣
We have the principal section *"Platos a la Carta"*, where you could buy products. We have a fixed header with the logo, name of the enterprise and buttons like *"Servicios"* (Services), *"Carrito"* (Shopping Cart) and *"Iniciar Sesion"* (Login).

* `Header Component`
In this component, I'm interested in how the components can be reused. Also, I want to know how Routes work so I used Link's components to redirect different pages. And something that I can solve is the change of text and icon in different sections.
*Index:*

*Servicios:*
![Services Header](https://github.com/Isaac4Lion/Catering-Web-Page/assets/92281039/244b5eeb-5ab1-40d8-a3fa-91e4277938f9)

I used useStates to make products and login buttons change the icon and text depending on what state they are.
* `Footer Component`
Another component applied on most pages
